# NU-Systematic-Alpha-Crude-Oil-ML-Model
Research project for Northeastern Systematic Alpha (NUSA), exploring Machine Learning models to forecast Crude Oil Prices

This project implements an oil price forecasting model based on the VMD-SE-GRU framework proposed in Zhang et al. (2023). The approach combines Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) to break down West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices into different frequency components, Sample Entropy (SE) to group similar components for reduced redundancy and faster computation, and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network to predict each grouped signal. The model uses the past 30 days of prices to forecast future values, reconstructing the final prediction by summing the forecasts of all grouped components. This decomposition–reconstruction strategy improves accuracy over single deep learning models, handles the nonlinear and volatile nature of oil prices, and significantly reduces training time with minimal loss in precision. Performance is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R², with results demonstrating strong predictive capability for both short- and medium-term oil price movements.
